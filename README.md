- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jing-tw from Taiwan.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Imaging processing, graduated from CS, National Chiao Tung University, NCTU.
- ðŸ’– Love solo hiking, learning to play piano, and coding for making useful tools. Oh yes, I also like exchanging interesting experiences with people. Just back from the Pingfeng Mt. 3,250m which is located in the middle of Taiwan island.
- ðŸŒ± In my free time, if I am not watching Netflix, play PS4 games, and sleeping, hiking, I make a tool to record GPS trace with display 3D terrain for myself to keep my hiking log.
